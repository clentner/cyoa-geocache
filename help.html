    <p>In this game, you follow the given GPS coordinates to find a geocache. This can be a hidden box,
       or simply a sign or plaque. Enter the secret word to advance to the next geocache. Secret words
       can be hidden inside the box, or they can be specific words from plaques or signs. There will
       often be a hint at the bottom of the page about where to find the secret word.</p>
       
    <p>Sometimes, there will be more than one word; which one you choose to enter will determine which
       "path" you go down, and which caches you visit.
